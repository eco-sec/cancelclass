‚úÖ Mock server started successfully!
üåê AJAX Request intercepted: /services/userapi/currentUser
‚úÖ Mocking: User API
‚úÖ User loaded: 107119

```

## Mock Data Details

### Training Types

2. Personal Emergency
3. Health Issues
4. Family Obligations
5. Conflicting Schedule
... and more

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Subordinates dropdown is empty
**Check:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console
2. Look for: `‚úÖ Mocking: Subordinates API`
3. If missing, mock server didn't intercept the call
4. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

### Issue: Classes dropdown is empty
**Check:**
1. Verify subordinate was selected
2. Check console for: `‚úÖ Mocking: Classes API`
3. Verify mock data structure in `/webapp/localService/mockdata.js`

### Issue: User not loaded
**Check:**
1. Console should show: `‚úÖ User loaded: 107119`
2. If showing "Error retrieving user info", mock API didn't respond
3. Default fallback username is "107119" - app should still work

### Issue: Cancellation fails
**Check:**
1. Console for: `‚úÖ Mocking: Cancel Class API`
2. Mock server should return success response
3. Check browser Network tab for failed requests

## Next Steps

Once all tests pass, you can:
1. Commit changes to git repository
2. Deploy to SAP Neo environment
3. Replace mock data with real backend services
4. Test with production credentials

## Mock Server Architecture

The mock server uses **jQuery ajaxPrefilter** to intercept ALL AJAX calls before they reach the network layer. This ensures:
- No actual HTTP requests are made
- Mock data is returned instantly
- No backend dependencies required
- All service patterns are tested locally

### Endpoints Mocked
1. `/services/userapi/currentUser` - User authentication
2. `/cpi/employee/getSubordinate` - Employee hierarchy
3. `/lmsproject/hana/xsodata/WorkflowReportService.xsodata/WorkflowLogView` - Class assignments
4. `/lmsproject/hana/xsjs/PicklistService.xsjs` - Cancellation reasons
5. `/cpi/LMS/cancelComplete` - Cancel class action

All endpoints return mock data from `/webapp/localService/mockdata.js`.
